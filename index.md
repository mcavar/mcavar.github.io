I am an associate professor at Indiana University, with a joint appointment in the Department of Linguistics and in the Slavic Department. I specialize in phonology and I am interested in both theoretical and laboratory phonology, second language phonology, aspects of heritage language, and forensic linguistics. In the last years I have concentrated on studies of speech using 2D or 3D ultrasound imaging.

Born in Warsaw, Poland, I have graduated with an MA in English from the University of Warsaw. I hold a PhD in Linguistics from the University of Potsdam, Germany. Since 2013, I have been employed at Indiana University.
