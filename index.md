I am an associate professor at [Indiana University Bloomington](https://bloomington.iu.edu/index.html), with a joint appointment in the [Department of Linguistics](https://linguistics.indiana.edu/index.html) and in the [Department of Slavic and East European Languages and Cultures](https://slavic.indiana.edu/). I specialize in phonology and I am interested in both theoretical and laboratory phonology, second language phonology, aspects of heritage language, and forensic linguistics. In the last years I have concentrated on studies of speech using 2D or 3D ultrasound imaging.

Born in [Warsaw](https://en.um.warszawa.pl/), Poland, I have graduated with an MA in English from the [University of Warsaw](https://en.uw.edu.pl/). I hold a PhD in Linguistics from the [University of Potsdam](https://www.uni-potsdam.de/en/university-of-potsdam), Germany. Since 2013, I have been employed at [Indiana University Bloomington](https://bloomington.iu.edu/index.html).
